## Course Description

Scripting can expand your abilities as a tester and help you keep up with the pace of agile development. It allows you to more quickly and efficiently find software issues and automate manual tasks such as reporting and test site preparation. This course examines a few ways to use scripts to solve common challenges faced in the fast-paced world of software testing. Follow along and learn how to navigate and test APIs, generate reports, explore products with web automation tools, generate dummy data for testing, and more. The lessons rely on simple Python-based scripts as well as popular testing tools such as Playwright, and Postman. They will also teach you how to use web scraping to your advantage and how to manipulate and generate images. 

Instructor Dave Westerveld provides concrete examples and ideas to increase your productivity, eliminate boring tasks, build new insights into products, and standardize and simplify your team's work.


## Instructions
You will find the various scripts for this course in the `course_scripts` folder. There is a subfolder in there for each video that has scripts available. So for example to find the scripts for video 5 from chapter 1, you would go to the [01_05 folder](./course_scripts/01_05)

It is reccommended that you try all exercises on your own before looking at the scripts. The scripts are provided as a way to check or debug your work, but you will have the greatest advances in your learning if you try to work through the examples on your own first!
